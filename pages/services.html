                  <div class="col-sm-3"><b><h4>Finance Advisory</h4></b>
				  <br><p style="text-align: justify;">We act as financial advisers to City of London based legal firms involved in debt negotiations on behalf of their clients with various financial institutions including banks and private equity funds.

We assist the legal firms throughout the negotiation process by conducting extensive review of the cases including facility, property, valuation, cash flows and financial documentation to inform our opinion of the specific case. Based on this review, we then offer strategic advice which outlines the optimal settlement levels and tactics to be employed in the negotiations to ensure the best outcome for clients.

We also work directly with clients to present credible restructuring and/or settlement proposals that work. We assist in formulating sensible property asset management strategies and business plans that maximise recovery/returns for all stakeholders, thus significantly improving borrower's chances of securing lender consent.

                  <div class="col-sm-3"><b><h4>Property Investment (Cash Flow Modelling) Advice</h4></b>
				  <p style="text-align: justify;">We advise our clients on whether an investment is worthwhile or not.

We develop bespoke financial models and perform detailed cash flow modelling on behalf of clients who either lack the skills or simply do not have the time.  

We prepare financial projections and discounted cash flow (DCF) calculations using the property information provided. We calculate various investment metrics such as net operating income (NOI), net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). Additionally, we use DCF techniques to estimate the value of the property and conduct research to ensure that the client is not paying more than the market value to purchase the property.
